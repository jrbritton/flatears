            <p style="font-family: nunito; color: #112A46;">This website is for my family back in the north of England and anyone else who likes dogs. It's a collection of photos of the three dogs in our family. Please click on one of the photos below to see a gallery for each dog.</p>

        <div class="foxy">
            <p>Foxy: An alsatian/collie cross. She was our first dog. She always got lots of attention when we took her out for walks, and she was extemely gentle and well tempered. Her nickname was 'Flatears' because her ears would go very flat when she was excited or happy.</p>
                <br/>
            </div>
        <div class="pepper">
            <p>Pepper: An alsatian possibly crossed with something else. She was very cute and often cheeky. Like all of our dogs, she came from a rescue centre. We know her mother was an alsatian because she was delivered to the centre pregnant. She and her five siblings were orginally named after the cast of Friends, and she was Rachel.</p>
            <br/>
        </div>
        <div class="sparky">
        <p>Sparky: A greyhound lurcher (a greyhound crossed with a saluki). The first male dog in the family. He's very quick, a little bit naughty, and extremely spoiled, but he's well-loved. He is 80% legs, and ends up in all sorts of bizarre positions when he falls asleep.</p>
